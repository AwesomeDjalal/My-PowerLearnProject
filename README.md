# My-PowerLearnProject
Urgent Care:  A telemedicine app built as my final PLP project. Features include a responsive frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and a backend powered by Node.js and Express.js. Integrated with a MySQL database, it enables user management, appointments, and medical record handling, enhancing virtual healthcare access.
