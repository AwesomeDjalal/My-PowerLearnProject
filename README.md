# My-PowerLearnProject
Urgent Care:  A telemedicine app built as my final PLP project. Features include a responsive frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and a backend powered by Node.js and Express.js. Integrated with a MySQL database, it enables user management, appointments, and medical record handling, enhancing virtual healthcare access.

The Urgent Care management system is a standalone cloud-based online infrastructure for medical management that collects and integrates data from all departments to automate internal processes. The primary goals of this system are to streamline physiciansâ€™ workflows, save administrative expenses, lessen manual mistakes, and improve patient experiences. However, this HIPAA compliant system manages every division or branch of the hospital, it covers a vast range of features.

The client-server system is based on enabling doctors, nurses, patients, accountants with a smooth process of connecting with each other. Every module will be designed according to the portfolio and user roles. This web-based solution gives access to the different features according to the user roles. This system will lead in saving time and energy by eliminating the need for redundant workflows, with the automated process.

The project Urgent Care Management System includes registration flow of patients, storing their details into the system, computerized billing in the pharmacy and laboratories.
